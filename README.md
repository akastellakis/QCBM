This repository contains an implementation of the Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) tailored for the Bars and Stripes (BAS) dataset.
The QCBM is a quantum machine learning framework utilizing variational quantum circuits to learn complex probability distributions. 
In this implementation, the QCBM is applied to the BAS dataset, generating patterns resembling horizontal stripes and vertical bars.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Quantum Computing SDK (Qiskit)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) from pyswarm
  
Make sure to install the necessary packages using pip install.

## Running the Code on a Real Quantum Device
To execute the code on an actual quantum device, you need to sign up on the IBM QUANTUM platform and create an account. Upon registration, you'll receive a token that should be integrated into the code. This token grants you the permission to run your code on a real quantum device.
